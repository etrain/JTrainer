This module is designed to scrape data from the J-Archive website.

It was written in a couple of hours on the train to help me learn scrapy.

It works, but is really rough around the edges as of 2011-01-13.

Installation
============

Just clone the module, and make sure you have scrapy installed.

Running
=======

Do it like this:
```scrapy crawl jarchive -o jarchive.json -t csv```
